## Darya Framework

Darya is a PHP framework consisting of components for making web applications.

These components include an autoloader, a router, a service container, an MVC foundation and simple abstractions for HTTP requests and responses.

The Darya framework is intended as a foundation for the Darya CMS project.

Inspired by PHP frameworks such as Laravel, Symfony and Phalcon.

### Note
I certainly don't intend for Darya to be the next big framework. I simply had enough desire and curiosity to reinvent every possible wheel and thought it might be worthy of open source project.
