## Darya Framework

Darya is a PHP framework for web application development.

Its components include:

- Autoloader
- Router & Dispatcher
- Service container
- MVC foundation
- Simple abstractions for HTTP requests and responses

The framework is intended as a foundation for the Darya CMS project.

Inspired by PHP frameworks such as Laravel, Phalcon and Symfony.

### Installation

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org)! The package name is `darya/framework`.

Otherwise, just clone this repository.

### Note
I certainly don't intend for Darya to be the next big PHP framework. I simply had enough desire and curiosity to reinvent every possible wheel and thought it might be worthy of open source project.
